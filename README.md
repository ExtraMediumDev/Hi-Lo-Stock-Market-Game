HI-LO GAME RULES:
Players: 4-10
Round Duration: 5 minutes per round
Objective: End each round with the highest monetary profit.

How the game works:
You will all trade an imaginary object with an unknown fair value determined by:
- Two rolls of a 20 sided die:
- One coin flip (Heads = HI, Tails = LO)

Fair Value Determination:
- Heads (HI): Fair value is the higher of the two rolls
- Tails (LO): Fair value is the lower of the two rolls
- 8+ Players: Roll three dice instead of two, and the coin flip determines whether the fair value the highest or lowest of the three dice rolls

Player Information:
Three players receive one piece of hidden information each:
- Value of the first die roll
- Value of the second die roll
- Coin flip result (HI/LO)

The remaining players will receive a trading contract:
- Format: [Long/Short, 1-5 trades]
    - Example: [Long, 4] ---> Player must buy the object at least 4 times.
- Failure to fulfill the contract: Automatic net loss of $100!

Trading Mechanics:
- Bid: Highest price a player is willing to buy the object.
- Ask: Lowest price a player is willing to sell the object.
- Posting Bids/Asks:
    - Bid: Must be higher than the current bid.
    - Ask: Must be lower than the current ask.

Example Trading Interaction:
Current Bid-Ask Values:
- Bid: 7
- Ask: 14
- Player 1: "Bid 8" → Increases the current bid.
- Player 4: "Ask 19" → Sets an asking price.
- Player 1: "Lift the Ask!" → Buys the object from Player 4 at $19.

End of Round:
- The fair value of the object is revealed.
- Each player's net profit/loss is calculated based on their trades.

Profit Example:
- Fair value: 15
- Player 1:
    - Long 2 units at $16
    - Short 1 unit at $18
- Net Profit: +$1
- The player with the highest profit wins the round.
- In multiple rounds: Total net profit/loss is tracked cumulatively.

Winning the Game:
- The player with the highest cumulative profit at the end of all rounds is declared the overall winner.

Good luck trading and have fun!
