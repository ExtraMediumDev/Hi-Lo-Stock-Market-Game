THE HI-LO GAME:
4-10 players
5 mins per round

Objective: 
Welcome to the Hi-Lo game! The goal of the game is to end with the most monetary profit.

How the game works:
You are all trading on an imaginary object with an unknown fair value. The value of the object is determined by two independent random factors: two rolls of a 20-sided die and a coin flip. If the coin lands heads, then the fair value of the object is the higher of the two dice rolls, and if the coin lands tails, then fair value of the object is the lower of the two dice rolls. But there's a catch: this information isn't publicly available. 

Each of you will receive a piece of information. One of you will receive the value of the first dice roll, another will receive the value of the second dice roll, and yet another will receive the result of the coin flip (either heads [HI] or tails [LO]). The rest of you will receive a contract that forces you to make a certain number of trades, either long or short. They will be in the format: long/short, some # between 1 and 5. (e.g. If your contract says [long, 4] then you have to buy the object at least 4 times to fulfill your contract.) If this contract is not fulfilled by the end of the round, then you automatically lose the round and receive a net loss of 100 dollars. A brief tutorial on how trading works is described below.

Bid and Ask:
The current bid value denotes the highest price someone is willing to buy the object for at the moment. The current ask value denotes the lowest price someone is willing to sell the object for at the moment. In order to post a bid, your bid must be higher than the current bid, and to post an ask, your ask must be lower than the current ask. An example post could be as such:

    Current Bid-Ask Values:
    Bid: 7   Ask: 14

Player 1: Bid 8.

    Current Bid-Ask Values:
    Bid: 8   Ask: 14

If you are satisfactory with the bid price, you can "hit the bid", or in other words, sell the object at that buyer's price. If you are satisfactory with the ask price, you can "lift the ask", or in other words, buy the object at that seller's price. An example is shown below:

Player 4: Ask 19.

    Current Bid-Ask Values:
    Bid: 15   Ask: 19

Player 1: Lift the Ask!
Player 1 has bought the object from Player 4 for 19 dollars. 

End of Round:
At the end of each round, the fair value for the object is shown and the net profit and loss for each player is calculated. For example, if the fair value was 15 and Player 1 is long 2 units at 16 dollars and short 1 unit at 18 dollars, then he would profit 1 dollar. The player with the highest profit by the end of the round is declared the winner!

Good luck trading and have fun!
