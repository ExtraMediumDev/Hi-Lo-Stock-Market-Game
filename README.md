## 🛠️ **How the Game Works**
- You will trade an **imaginary object** with an **unknown fair value**.
- **Fair Value is determined by:**
   - **Two rolls of a 20-sided die** *(or three rolls with 8+ players)*
   - **One coin flip:**
     - **Heads (HI):** Fair value = **Highest roll**
     - **Tails (LO):** Fair value = **Lowest roll**

**8+ Players Special Rule:**
- Roll **three dice** instead of two.
- **Coin flip** determines if fair value is the **highest** or **lowest** of the three rolls.
